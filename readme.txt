0.1 -  Added arrow beside ARS BTC MAIN Value, which will change depending on the percentage change with
regards to yesterday's BTC value. If the percentage increased, it will show a green arrow, and if you hover it will show the total % change. If the value decreased,
it will show a red arrow.
    - I will try and add a section with the BTC value in USD, and also with the arrows, or maybe a USD to ARS
